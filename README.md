# Packease Framework for Java

We would like to build an approachable framework for learning and understanding the Java Web programming techniques. 
It is very funny and easy to read the sample codes in the project. 
We built it with the MVC design pattern, which is the most famous design pattern all around the world.

## Quick Guide

1. You need to install a MySQL database, our project depends on it because of MyBatis usages.
2. To modify parameters of database resource, which wrote on the file `config/config-dev.properties`.
3. After finishing two steps above, you could now start up your server/container such as Jetty/Tomcat/JBoss.
4. Any of URLs below will show you some information that generated by project services.

    * http://localhost:8080/index?id=1
    * http://localhost:8080/json
    * http://localhost:8080/json4/{id}, you could replace `{id}` with any integer value.
    * http://localhost:8080/db, this could help you query the db data.
    
5. Here is the db table structures, this table is just design for developing, not for production environment.

```sql
CREATE TABLE `param` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COMMENT='demo';
```
